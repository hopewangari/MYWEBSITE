<h4>Sensors</h4>
<br>
<p>Sensors are devices that detect physical parameters or changes in their environment and convert them into measurable 
    signals, typically electrical.They act as the "eyes" and "ears" of a system, providing data about the world.</p>
    <h5>Types of sensors</h5>
    <p>Sensors can be categorized in several ways, including by their power requirement, means of detection, or output type
        Some common types include:
        <dl>
  <dt>Temparature sensors:Measures heat and cold. </dt>
  <dd>Applications: HVAC systems, medical devices (thermometers), industrial monitoring,
     household appliances (refrigerators, water heaters).</dd>
  <dt>Pressure Sensors: Detect the force exerted by a fluid (liquid or gas).</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Automotive tire pressure monitoring, blood pressure monitors, industrial equipment for
     predictive maintenance, weather stations.</dd>
    
  <dt>Proximity Sensors: Detect the presence or absence of an 
    object without physical contact.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphones (screen auto-darkening during calls), 
    automated doors, parking sensors, robotics.</dd>
  <dt>Light Sensors (Photodetectors): Measure light intensity</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphone display brightness adjustment, camera apertures, adaptive lighting 
    systems (car headlights, streetlights).</dd>
  <dt>Humidity Sensors: Measure the moisture content in the air.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: HVAC systems, weather monitoring, greenhouses, food storage</dd>
  <dt>Accelerometers: Measure the rate of change of velocity (acceleration) and 
    detect tilt or vibration.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphones (orientation detection), car electronics, 
    gaming controllers, robotics.</dd>
  <dt>Position Sensors: Detect an object's position and movement. This includes linear, rotary, 
    and tilt sensors.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Robotics, automotive systems, industrial machinery for
     control and operation.</dd>
  <dt>Gas Sensors: Detect and measure the concentration of different gases.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Industrial safety systems, air quality monitoring, 
    carbon monoxide detectors.</dd>
  <dt>Flow Sensors: Detect the rate at which a fluid moves through a system.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Water treatment, HVAC, automotive systems, chemical industries.</dd>
  <dt>Image Sensors: Convert optical images into electrical signals</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Digital cameras, surveillance systems, medical imaging.</dd>

<h4>Actuators</h4>
<br>
<p>An actuator is a component of a machine that converts energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, etc.) into mechanical force to produce controlled physical motion. 
    They are the "muscles" of a system, enabling it to perform actions.</p>
    <h5>Types of actuators</h5>
    <p>Actuators are typically classified by their power source or the type of motion they produce:</p>
