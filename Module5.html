<h4>Sensors</h4>
<br>
<p>Sensors are devices that detect physical parameters or changes in their environment and convert them into measurable 
    signals, typically electrical.They act as the "eyes" and "ears" of a system, providing data about the world.</p>
    <h5>Types of sensors</h5>
    <p>Sensors can be categorized in several ways, including by their power requirement, means of detection, or output type
        Some common types include:
        <dl>
  <dt>Temparature sensors:Measures heat and cold. </dt>
  <dd>Applications: HVAC systems, medical devices (thermometers), industrial monitoring,
     household appliances (refrigerators, water heaters).</dd>
  <dt>Pressure Sensors: Detect the force exerted by a fluid (liquid or gas).</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Automotive tire pressure monitoring, blood pressure monitors, industrial equipment for
     predictive maintenance, weather stations.</dd>
    
  <dt>Proximity Sensors: Detect the presence or absence of an 
    object without physical contact.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphones (screen auto-darkening during calls), 
    automated doors, parking sensors, robotics.</dd>
  <dt>Light Sensors (Photodetectors): Measure light intensity</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphone display brightness adjustment, camera apertures, adaptive lighting 
    systems (car headlights, streetlights).</dd>
  <dt>Humidity Sensors: Measure the moisture content in the air.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: HVAC systems, weather monitoring, greenhouses, food storage</dd>
  <dt>Accelerometers: Measure the rate of change of velocity (acceleration) and 
    detect tilt or vibration.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Smartphones (orientation detection), car electronics, 
    gaming controllers, robotics.</dd>
  <dt>Position Sensors: Detect an object's position and movement. This includes linear, rotary, 
    and tilt sensors.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Robotics, automotive systems, industrial machinery for
     control and operation.</dd>
  <dt>Gas Sensors: Detect and measure the concentration of different gases.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Industrial safety systems, air quality monitoring, 
    carbon monoxide detectors.</dd>
  <dt>Flow Sensors: Detect the rate at which a fluid moves through a system.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Water treatment, HVAC, automotive systems, chemical industries.</dd>
  <dt>Image Sensors: Convert optical images into electrical signals</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Digital cameras, surveillance systems, medical imaging.</dd>

<h4>Actuators</h4>
<br>
<p>An actuator is a component of a machine that converts energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, etc.) into mechanical force to produce controlled physical motion. 
    They are the "muscles" of a system, enabling it to perform actions.</p>
    <h5>Types of actuators</h5>
    <p>Actuators are typically classified by their power source or the type of motion they produce:</p>
     <dl>
  <dt>Linear Actuators: Produce straight-line motion 
    (pushing, pulling, lifting, lowering)./dt>
  <dd>Applications: Conveyor systems, robotic arms (for extension), positioning mechanisms.
 </dd>
  <dt>Rotary Actuators: Generate circular motion.</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Rotating machinery parts, automated valves, robotic joints (for rotation).
 </dd>
  <dt>Electric Actuators: Use electrical energy (motors, solenoids, piezoelectric elements) to generate motion.
</dt>
  <dd>Advantages: High precision, good control, low maintenance, relatively clean.

Applications: Robotics, automated industrial processes, medical devices, conveyor systems,
 smart home devices (e.g., automated blinds).</dd>
  <dt>Hydraulic Actuators: Utilize pressurized fluid (usually oil) to create motion, typically through cylinders or pistons
</dt>
  <dd>Advantages: High force output, excellent precision, robust for heavy-duty applications.

Applications: Construction equipment (excavators, cranes), heavy machinery, industrial presses, aircraft landing gear.
</dd>
  <dt>Pneumatic Actuators: Use compressed air to produce motion.</dt>
  <dd>Advantages: High speed, simple design, cost-effective, can operate in hazardous environments.

Applications: Packaging and bottling plants, assembly lines, automation tasks requiring rapid, cyclic operations, valve control.
</dd>
  <dt>Mechanical Actuators: Employ physical mechanisms like levers, gears, or cams to generate motion.
</dt>
  <dd>Advantages: Simple operation, durability, low cost.

Applications: Manual valve systems, locks, hand-crank machines
</dd>
  <dt>Piezoelectric Actuators: Utilize the piezoelectric effect, where certain materials change shape when an electrical charge is applied.
    /dt>
  <dd>Advantages: Very precise, fast response, high-frequency movements.

Applications: Precision positioning, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), optical devices
</dd>
  <dt>Thermal Actuators: Use the expansion or contraction of materials in response to temperature changes to produce motion.
</dt>
  <dd>Applications: Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), automatic vents, circuit breakers.
