<h4>I2C</h4>
<p>A synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave serial bus that uses only two wires: SDA (Serial Data Line) for data and SCL (Serial Clock Line) for synchronization. It's known for its simplicity and 
    fficiency in short-distance communication.</p>
    <h5>Characteristics</h5>
<p>Two-wire communication, supports multiple devices on the same bus, relatively slower speed compared to SPI, ideal for communication between microcontrollers and lower-speed peripherals like temperature sensors, accelerometers, EEPROMs, and some display drivers. 
    Each device has a unique address.</p>
    <h6>Applications</h6>
    <p>Commonly found in embedded systems for reading data from sensors (e.g., environmental sensors, IMUs) and controlling small actuators 
        (e.g., servo motors with I2C interfaces).</p>
 <h4>UART</h4>
 <p>An asynchronous serial communication protocol that uses two wires: TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive). Asynchronous means there's no shared clock signal; instead, 
    both sides must agree on a baud rate (data transfer speed) beforehand.</p>
    <h5>Characteristics</h5>
    <p>Two-wire communication, point-to-point (typically one sender and one receiver), no clock line, simpler to implement in software, but requires precise baud rate matching. 
        It frames data with start and stop bits.</p>
        <h6>Applications</h6>
        <p>Widely used for debugging (e.g., sending data to a computer's serial monitor), communicating with GPS modules, Bluetooth modules, Wi-Fi modules, and 
            some serial-controlled actuators that require a stream of data.</p>
<h4>SPI</h4>
<p>A synchronous, full-duplex, master-slave serial communication protocol that typically uses four wires: MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), SCK (Serial Clock), and SS (Slave Select).
     Full-duplex means data can be sent and received simultaneously.</p>
     <h5>Characteristics</h5>
     <p>Four-wire communication (though variations exist), dedicated clock line, very high data transfer speeds, supports multiple slave devices (each requiring a separate SS line from the master), 
        but requires more pins than I2C.</p>
        <h6>Applications</h6>
        <p>Preferred for high-speed data transfer with devices like SD card readers, flash memory, high-resolution ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters), DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters), 
            and some fast display controllers.</p>
